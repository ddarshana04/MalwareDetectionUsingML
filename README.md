# MalwareDetectionUsingML
Simple antimalware system with machine learning [Random Forest classifier] to analyze files and determine whether they are malicious or not. And finally store all the input and output files in MongoDB.

One common approach is to use a RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER, which is a type of decision tree algorithm that creates multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to make a final decision. The random forest algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset of known malware and benign files, which includes various features such as file size, file type, and file content.

To build a simple antimalware system with machine learning, you would need to follow a few key steps:

Collect a dataset of known malware and benign files: This dataset will be used to train and test the machine learning algorithm.
Extract features from the files: Features could include file size, file type, and file content. The features should be relevant to determining whether a file is malicious or not.
Train a random forest classifier: Using the labeled dataset and the extracted features, train a random forest classifier to predict whether a file is malicious or benign.
Test the classifier: Use a separate set of labeled files to test the classifier's accuracy and effectiveness.
Integrate the classifier into an antimalware system: Once you have a trained and tested classifier, you can integrate it into an antimalware system that can scan and analyze files for malware. This could involve building a user interface and integrating the classifier into the scanning and detection process.

After the antimalware system with machine learning is trained and tested, the results can be stored in a MongoDB database for further analysis or reference. Here's how you can add the results into a MongoDB database:

Install the MongoDB driver for Python using pip install pymongo.
Import the pymongo module in your Python script.
Connect to the MongoDB database using the MongoClient class and specify the host and port.
Create a new database in MongoDB using the database_names() method of the MongoClient object.
Create a new collection in the database using the create_collection() method of the Database object.
Insert the results into the collection using the insert_one() or insert_many() method of the Collection object.
